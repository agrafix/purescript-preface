## Design

The Preface is intended to be a simpler introduction to the concepts of PureScript for beginners, specifically those
coming from Javascript. With that in mind, here are some design goals:

- Use simple types - no type classes, effect rows, etc.
- Provide excellent documentation with examples.
- Name functions using simple names which explain their purpose.

The Preface is meant to be a _teaching tool_, such that users should plan to graduate to the regular set of PureScript core libraries once they are familiar with the ideas. However, the Preface may be a practical alternative for some very simple tasks.
